Hi, I'm Aaron Qian.

**I help software engineers achieve career goals.** I believe there are often overlooked, but effective ways to advance your career without burning yourself out.

I'm a software engineer coach, a veteran software architect, and a custom software solutions consultant. I have been in the software startup industry since 2006. I started out as a software test engineer and slowly progressed to architect position over the years. Since 2021, I started my own consulting practice to help software engineers to advance their careers.

On this site, you will find my daily tips that will help you grow as a software engineer quickly and effectively. These tips will include a mix of technical and nontechnical topics. 

I hope my lifetime of learnings in the software industry can be a small beacon to guide you on the misty landscape of software career.
